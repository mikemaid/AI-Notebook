  In this program, I hope to gain foundational skills in AI so I can develop programs of my own, and I look forward to being a part of a collaborative learning environment

   From Dr. Kong's leadership seminar, I learned of how my though process and communication skills changed over the course of my childhood due to my exposure in different communities of sports. I realized how important my communication skill development was to the opportunities I've gained and the person I am, and I wonder how my new ability to adapt to new situations aided me in being able to reach out to communities and help them.

  I. Supervised learning is a model that is trained using pre-defined examples and "labels" while unsupervised learning is is when the program is given data and finds patterns and relationships from said data to make predictions.
  
  II. Scikit-Learn is built on top of visualization libraries like Graphviz and Pandas. Therefore, Scikit-Learn does not have the power to visualize data without a Graphviz, Pandas, or other data analysis libraries.

  **Real-world Problem:** There is an increased amount of toxins in the environment due to the increase in landfills. This ultimately increases land, water, and air pollution and toxic waste consumption by animals leads to devestation of ecosystems.
  
  **Data set:** [Kaggle Waste Classification Data](https://www.kaggle.com/techsash/waste-classification-data) contains imagines of organic and recyclable cobjects. 
  
  **Deep Learning Algorithm to use:** The ideal DL algorithm for this dataset would be Generative adversarial neural networks, which essentially generates patterns to distinguish gemuine samples from the fake ones. Essentially, this model would reject samples that are not recyclable and create samples that are recyclable, which means the model will classify the samples into two categories.

  **1. What are “Tensors” and what are they used for in Machine Learning?**
  A tensor is a representation of a physical object that is characterized by magnitude and multiple directions. Tensors are used in Machine Learning for storing multi-dimensional data.
  
**2. What did you notice about the computations that you ran in the TensorFlow
programs (i.e. interactive models) in the tutorial?**
Tensorflow functions define the model, but do not actually complete the desired action unless there is an interactive session running. Also, the datasets have to be processed before training the model for better identification of relationships between data (feature extraction).
